## Abstract
The process of acquiring a Police Clearance Certificate at El Salvador City Police Station could be more efficient. Thus, the researchers proposed an intranet-based Police Clearance Issuance System for El Salvador City, Misamis Oriental - Police Station. This proposed system aims to hasten the procedure of requesting and releasing a Police Clearance Certificate, implement a system to monitor applicants’ records, implement monitoring and tracking of applicant’s information through a QR code that would replace the current Barcode, organize the storing of data that makes the retrieval of records faster, and to create a system that systematizes the generation of 2 x 2 photo, e-signature, and e-thumbmark of the applicant. This study has immensely helped El Salvador City, Misamis Oriental – Police Station on their releasing of Police Clearance Certificate
